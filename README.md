Template converted to Jekyll at [Online-CV](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv), from which this template is forked.

Relevant CSS files:
- _sass/_base.css # Contains the main css for different classes used in the template
- _sass/skins/_{color}.scss # This folder actually contains the css for all the color schemes.
CSS files for font packages used as icons for email, CV, google scholar, etc. 
- assets/plugins/font-awesome/css/all.css 
- assets/plugins/academicons-1.9.1/css/academicons.css

To set this up for your own professional website, fork/download the source and update the _config.yml file with your own url, name, etc.

To test your site locally, install Jekyll on your system and call
jekyll serve [-I] in the top level of the repo.

You can then see how your site would render locally by navigating to http://localhost:4000/ in your browser.

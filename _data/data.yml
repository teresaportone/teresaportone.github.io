    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am a staff research scientist in the Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification department at Sandia National Laboratories.

My research interests include:
        #        - model-form uncertainty quantification
        #        - validation and reliability of computational models used for prediction
        #        - developing and deploying advanced UQ methods for practical problems in science and engineering
      #     I am an avid cook, choral singer, and photographer.

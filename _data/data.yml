    title: About Me
    details: |
      I am a staff research scientist in the Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification department at Sandia National Laboratories. Prior to my current position at Sandia, I was a PhD Student in the [Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics PhD Program](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/graduate-studies/), housed in the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at UT Austin](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/). My research interests include:
        - model-form uncertainty (model-form error/model inadequacy/model discrepancy)
        - Bayesian inference
        - sensitivity analysis
        - multimodel (multilevel/multifidelity) uncertainty quantification
        - validation and reliability of computational models used for prediction
      
        I am an avid cook, choral singer, and photographer.
